# Monitor+ API Python Projects

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

![image](https://www.sarus.com/resources/images/monitorPlus.png)    

This repository contains basic Python/Jupyter  files to  demonstrate the functionality of the Monitor+ API.
The demos use  some historic European Central bank rates to show some basic to advanced analytic features.
They are designed to demonstrate what can be easily achieved with a few lins of code and are <b>not</b> meant in ANY way to be solutions. 

We will be providing demos in both Python and "R" to get users started.  This  repository is used as a test bed to run the demos in Binder.


## About Monitor+
Monitor+ is a commercial JSON Web API that provides easy access to a huge range of historical reference market data from stock exchanges, commodity exchanges, proprietary market data providers and independent pricing agencies as well as currencies, global indices and more.

Monitor+ is an extremely powerful API, with comprehensive data preprocessing, fills, lead/lags, custom averages and more. The Monitor+ API  enables subscribers to easily receive market data in a per date, time series or row by column JSON format.
