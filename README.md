This repository contains some Python/Jupyter files that demonstrate the functionality of the Monitor+ API.
The demos use some historic European Central bank rates to show some basic to advanced analytic notebook reoports.
They are designed to demonstrate what can be easily achieved with just a few lines of Python code and are <b>not in ANY way</b> meant to be solutions. 

We will be providing demos in both Python and "R" to help get users started.  This repository is mainly used as a test bed to test running the  demos in Binder.


## About Monitor+

Monitor+ is an extremely powerful API, with comprehensive data preprocessing, fills, lead/lags, custom averages and more. The Monitor+ API  enables subscribers to easily receive market data for multiple datasets in a per date, time series or row by column JSON format.
