This repository contains basic Python/Jupyter  files to  demonstrate the functionality of the Monitor+ API.
The demos use  some historic European Central bank rates to show some analytic features.

We will be providing demos in both Pythonb and "R" to get users started.  This  repository is used as a test bed to run the demos in Binder.


## About Monitor+
