##   UNDER CONSTRUCTION   ##

![image](https://www.sarus.com/resources/images/monitorPlus.png)    

This repository contains basic Python/Jupyter  files to  demonstrate the functionality of the Monitor+ API.
The demos use  some historic European Central bank rates to show some basic to advanced analytic features.
They are designed to demonstrate what can be easily achieved with a few lins of code and are <b>not in ANY way</b> meant to be solutions. 

We will be providing demos in both Python and "R" to get users started.  This  repository is used as a test bed to run the demos in Binder.
